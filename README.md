# Mikrotik Google Address List Generator

This repository's `command.txt` file contains a terminal
command for Mikrotik's RouterOS that creates an address list named "google" in the firewall.
This address list includes all publicly known IP addresses that belong to Google, except the addresses of Google's DNS servers.
This command can be updated by running the script also provided in this
repository. The script works by downloading a list of IP
addresses provided by Google.

## Goal

My original goal was to block YouTube access on a specific device on my network. Having found
no effective way to do it, I finally settled for blocking all Google services. This solution is obviously not viable for everyone,
but it works for me as no other app requiring access to Google
services is installed on the device.
Having a list of Google addresses allowed me to block access to
these addresses from a specific device by adding a firewall rule
using that list.
